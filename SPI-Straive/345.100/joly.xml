The legislation which governs the Producer Offset is contained in division IV376 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 (<emphasis

A &ldquo;security interest&rdquo;, as defined in the PPSA, can be taken over copyright and other intellectual property (IP), however section 12(5) of the PPSA excludes IP licences from being registrable as a security interest under the PPSA. Security interests may be registered in relation to IP such as in relation to a security interest created by a partial assignment of copyright or in relation to a transaction that secures payment or performance of an obligation in relation to copyright. If it is appropriate to create a security interest in the copyright in the film, it would be created in a separate document. As the financing of the cinematographic film may involve different financiers seeking security interests, it may also be necessary to document the priority between claimants of security interests in the copyright of the film.</entry>

It is a matter of negotiation between the investor and the production company how to deal with any adverse events including overages. One way of dealing with adverse production events (particularly for films with medium to high production budgets) is for the production company to contract with a company offering Completion Guarantees in respect of the production of films and television productions (a <emphasis

<entry align="left" spanname="SPAN1"><?Pub _cellfont TypeSize="9pt"?>This precedent is an agreement to engage the services of a director through a service company. With some simple adaptations, it would be suitable for engaging the services of a line-producer (where a production company has a number of projects running, it will engage the services of a number of line-producers to look after each of those films). If the director is to be engaged as an employee, then all references to the lender should be deleted and other necessary changes made in order to acknowledge that PAYG tax must be deducted by the production company with the employed director being entitled to payment of superannuation under the superannuation guarantee scheme and may have an entitlement to holiday pay under the relevant state or territory holiday pay act.</entry>

<entry align="left" spanname="SPAN1"><?Pub _cellfont TypeSize="9pt"?>The Copyright Act recognises moral rights as applying to the &ldquo;authors&rdquo; of the literary, dramatic and musical works and to cinematograph films. Moral rights therefore vest in the author of a novel or other source material for a film (as &ldquo;literary work&rdquo;); a writer of a screenplay (as a &ldquo;dramatic work&rdquo;); the composer of a song or music written for the sound-track of a film (as a &ldquo;musical work&rdquo;).</entry>

</row>
<row>
<entry align="left" spanname="SPAN1"><?Pub _cellfont TypeSize="9pt"?>Waivers of moral rights are often a requirement of investors, distributors and broadcasters of films, video and television productions. The traditional justification for seeking waivers of moral rights is that those entities intending to exploit the film do not want to have the risk of injunction proceedings or actions for damages arising from claims of infringement of the moral rights of authors which may well arise from the acts of the production company. However, under the moral rights regime in the Copyright Act, while an &ldquo;author&rdquo; may give a written consent to any act which may amount to an infringement of moral rights the &ldquo;author&rdquo; is not able to waive their moral rights. While this distinction may appear to be subtle the practical consequence is that the drafting of the author&rsquo;s consent may require negotiation.</entry>
</row>
<row>
<entry align="left" spanname="SPAN1"><?Pub _cellfont TypeSize="9pt"?>The SPA (http://www.screenproducers.org.au) has negotiated with the Australian Writers&rsquo; Guild (<emphasis type="bold">AWG</emphasis>) (see http://www.awg.com.au) a moral industry accord which provides for a form of consent together with a moral rights dispute resolution procedure. A copy of this industry accord is available to members of either SPA or AWG. The use of the &ldquo;Moral Rights Industry Accord&rdquo; may provide a solution to the treatment of moral rights (particularly of all financing participants if Australian entities).</entry>
</row>
<row>
<entry align="left" spanname="SPAN1"><?Pub _cellfont TypeSize="9pt"?>Given that UK and USA law allow for waivers of moral rights (the UK and USA being the jurisdiction of key investors, distributors and broadcasters), issues will arise in dealing with moral rights in a way which is satisfactory to those entities intending to exploit the film and also to the authors of a film (the principal screenwriter, director and producer).</entry>

<entry align="left" spanname="SPAN1"><?Pub _cellfont TypeSize="9pt"?>The drafting of confidentiality provisions (clause 11) should take account of the view of the High Court of Australia in <emphasis type="ital">Maggbury Pty Ltd v Hafele Australia Pty Ltd</emphasis
> (2001) 185 ALR 152; [2001] HCA 70; BC200107781. The HCA considered that the covenant not to disclose information (which was not limited to information outside the public domain, nor limited in time) was an unenforceable restraint of trade. While the case involved confidentiality of information related to a patented invention, the HCA&rsquo;s decision does nevertheless draw attention to the need to take account of circumstances in which the information (which is intended to be held in confidence) may become public knowledge without the disclosure to the public being the &ldquo;fault&rdquo; of the party giving the confidentiality undertaking. While the production company may legitimately want to control publicity about the film, script and aspects of the production, a &ldquo;blanket&rdquo; confidentiality clause runs the risk of being invalid and unenforceable under the doctrine of restraint of trade. This would occur if the &ldquo;blanket&rdquo; confidentiality clause does not differentiate between information which is only confidential until disclosed to the public during the marketing of the film (such film-related information will then become &ldquo;public domain&rdquo; information) and the confidential information related to the business affairs of the production company.</entry>

ASDACS was set up as a non-profit collecting society to collect and distribute claim royalties that are generated from European collecting societies and in other territories through rights that are recognised there and collectively managed on behalf of the film and television directors arising from &ldquo;secondary&rdquo; use of copyright material that is recognised under the Berne Convention, related to blank cassette sale levies, cable retransmission of free-to-air TV, copying done by educational institutions, and video rental.</entry>
</row>
<row>
<entry align="left" spanname="SPAN1"><?Pub _cellfont TypeSize="9pt"?>The Copyright Amendment (Film Directors&rsquo; Rights) Act 2005 (Cth) amends section 98 of the Copyright Act to grant a director of a film an interest in the copyright only so far as the copyright consists of the right to include the film in retransmission of a free-to-air broadcast. This amendment allows the director to claim a share of the royalties under any Australian subscription television retransmission scheme. Clause 21 is intended to be consistent with the 2005 amendment, although clause 21 is broader in that it would apply to retransmission schemes in any other jurisdictions which allocates royalties to the director of a film. Note that this director&rsquo;s agreement engages the services of the director as an &ldquo;independent contractor&rdquo; rather than an employee. Note that the effect of s 98(5) in relation to directors engaged under an employment agreement is that, in the absence of any agreement to the contrary, the employer is to be substituted for the director for the purposes of s 98(4). If the director is engaged under an employment contract (contract of service), the ability of the director to claim a share of the royalties under the Australian subscription television retransmission scheme will be a matter of negotiation. Clause 21 should be deleted if a director under a &ldquo;contract of service&rdquo; is not intended to claim such royalties.</entry>

<entry align="left" spanname="SPAN1"><?Pub _cellfont TypeSize="9pt"?>This precedent is an agreement between a producer and a writer to engage the writer to write an episode script for a television series.

</row>
<row>
<entry align="left" spanname="SPAN1"><?Pub _cellfont TypeSize="9pt"?>A writer may have to be engaged as soon as the &ldquo;option agreement&rdquo; in relation to the underlying work (such as a novel) is signed (see precedent &ldquo;Script option and assignment agreement&rdquo;). The writer creates a &ldquo;literary work&rdquo; or &ldquo;dramatic work&rdquo; (as understood under the Copyright Act 1968 (Cth) (<emphasis
type="bold">Copyright Act</emphasis>)), therefore the control by the production company of the copyright in the works being created (described in the film industry terms of synopsis, treatment, script/screenplay) by the writer is very important given the effect of sections 35 and 196 of the Copyright Act. A written assignment from the writer is necessary for the production company to be able to assert that it is the owner of the literary work or dramatic work which will eventually be the script/screenplay for the cinematograph film (as defined in section 10(1) of the Copyright Act as any moving picture).</entry>

The following &ldquo;Writer&rsquo;s agreement&rdquo; is not drafted in the same way as the AWG/SPA &ldquo;Series and serials agreement&rdquo;. Instead it operates on the basis that the production company will negotiate a fee which is a &ldquo;buy-out&rdquo; of all exploitation rights.</entry>

<entry align="left" spanname="SPAN1"><?Pub _cellfont TypeSize="9pt"?>The AWG/SPA contract for series and serials operates with a &ldquo;minimum basic use fee&rdquo; upon payment of which specific exploitation rights in the script vest in the production company.

Additional payments (residuals) are also due for payment to the writer under the AWG/SPA contract.</entry>

		</entry>
</row>
<row>
<entry align="left" spanname="SPAN1"><?Pub _cellfont TypeSize="9pt"?>The traditional justification for seeking waivers of moral rights is that those entities intending to exploit the film (broadcasters of films, video and television productions) do not want to have the risk of injunction proceedings or actions for damages arising from claims of infringement of the moral rights of authors which may well arise from the acts of the production company. Under the moral rights regime in the Copyright Act an &ldquo;author&rdquo; may give a written consent to any act which may amount to an infringement of moral rights. However, the &ldquo;author&rdquo; is not able to completely &ldquo;waive&rdquo; his or her moral rights. The practical consequence is that the drafting of the author&rsquo;s consent may require negotiation to provide a treatment of moral rights which is acceptable to the writer and acceptable to the production company and its financiers.</entry>
</row>
<row>
<entry align="left" spanname="SPAN1"><?Pub _cellfont TypeSize="9pt"?>The SPA has negotiated with the AWG to produce a moral industry accord which provides for a form of consent together with a moral rights dispute resolution procedure. A copy of the industry accord is available to members of either SPA or AWG. The use of the &ldquo;Moral Rights Industry Accord&rdquo; may provide a solution to the treatment of moral rights, particularly if all financing participants are Australian entities.</entry>
</row>
<row>
<entry align="left" spanname="SPAN1"><?Pub _cellfont TypeSize="9pt"?>Given that UK and USA law allow for waivers of moral rights (the UK and USA being the jurisdiction of key investors, distributors and broadcasters), issues will arise in dealing with moral rights in a way which is satisfactory to those entities intending to exploit the film and also to the authors of a film (the principal screenwriter, the director and producer).

> (2001) 185 ALR 152; [2001] HCA 70; BC200107781. The HCA considered that the covenant not to disclose information (which was not limited to information outside the public domain, nor limited in time) was an unenforceable restraint of trade. While that case involved confidentiality of information related to a patented invention, nevertheless the High Court decision does draw attention to the need to take account of circumstances in which the information (which is intended to be held in confidence) may become public knowledge without the disclosure to the public being the &ldquo;fault&rdquo; of the party giving the confidentiality undertaking. The production company may legitimately want to control publicity about the film, script and aspects of the production. However, a &ldquo;blanket&rdquo; confidentiality clause runs the risk of being unenforceable under the doctrine of restraint of trade if it does not differentiate between information which is only confidential until disclosed to the public during the marketing of the film (such film-related information will then become &ldquo;public domain&rdquo; information) and the trade secrets and confidential information related to the business affairs of the production company.</entry>

PAYG tax will be deducted under the technician&rsquo;s agreement unless there is a bona fide basis on which the technician is entitled to be paid as an &ldquo;independent contractor&rdquo;: see clause 2.2.

</row>
<row>
<entry align="left" spanname="SPAN1"><?Pub _cellfont TypeSize="9pt"?>Note that the MPPCA contains a standard form crew agreement which incorporates the provisions of the MPPCA. However, a production company, even if it is subject to the MPPCA may choose to use its own form of crew agreement. If the production company is subject to the MPPCA then the terms and conditions offered to the crew member cannot be inconsistent with the terms and conditions of the MPPCA.</entry>

Part XIA does not create a &ldquo;copyright&ldquo; in the performance.

Therefore, the engagement of an actor should be in writing and provide the performer&rsquo;s consent to the exploitation of his or her performance by the production company, its assignees and licensees. The Actor&rsquo;s agreement also deals with the performer&rsquo;s moral rights that were introduced by the US Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act 2004 (Cth) into part IX of the Copyright Act 1968 (Cth).</entry>

<entry align="left" spanname="SPAN1"><?Pub _cellfont TypeSize="9pt"?>Note that clause (c)(iii) includes a waiver in respect to any liability under the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth) (<emphasis type="bold">CCA</emphasis>), which replaced the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) (<emphasis
type="bold">TPA</emphasis>). Liability under section 52 TPA (section 18 of schedule 2, CCA) may arise in the circumstances in which an Appearance Release is obtained from an interviewee. <emphasis type="ital">Hearn v O&apos;Rourke</emphasis> (2003) 129 FCR 63; ATPR 41-931; [2003] FCAFC 78 reversed the Federal Court decision in <emphasis
type="ital">Hearn v O&apos;Rourke</emphasis> [2002] FCA 1179, in relation to the application of the &ldquo;misleading and deceptive&rdquo; provisions of section 52 TPA with respect to a film producer obtaining an appearance release. This case considered whether a person interviewed in a documentary film could sue the producer of the documentary film when the interviewee later objected to their portrayal in the film. The majority of the Full Federal Court accepted that there was a connection between the conduct alleged in the statement of claim and the respondent&apos;s commercial activities in making and distributing films and held that the phrase &ldquo;in trade or commerce&rdquo; in section 52 TPA applied, as there could be no documentary unless appropriate interviews were secured. Securing such interviews, was considered to be central to the trading or commercial activity in which the film producer was engaged in producing a film for profit. Correspondingly, the conduct engaged in by the first respondent for that purpose could itself be found to be &ldquo;in&rdquo; trade or commerce, as discussed in <emphasis

<entry align="left" spanname="SPAN1"><?Pub _cellfont TypeSize="9pt"?>Waivers of moral rights are often a requirement of investors, distributors and broadcasters of films, video and television productions. The traditional justification for seeking waivers of moral rights is that those entities intending to exploit the film do not want to have the risk of injunction proceedings or actions for damages arising from claims of infringement of the moral rights of authors which may well arise from the acts of the production company. However, under the moral rights regime in the Copyright Act 1968 (Cth), while an &ldquo;author&rdquo; may give a written consent to any act which may amount to an infringement of moral rights the &ldquo;author&rdquo; is not able to waive their moral rights. While this distinction may appear to be subtle the practical consequence is that the drafting of the author&rsquo;s consent may require negotiation.</entry>

If the &ldquo;musical work&rdquo; (the recording of which is the &ldquo;sound recording&rdquo;) is still within the term of copyright, then the production company will need to obtain a licence from the composer or music publisher to synchronise the &ldquo;musical work&rdquo; in the soundtrack of the film or television production (see &ldquo;Synchronisation licence&rdquo;).</entry>

However, determining whether a &ldquo;musical work&rdquo; is in the public domain can be a complex issue, unless the work is very old, as works may remain in copyright in some jurisdictions but can be in the public domain in other jurisdictions. Countries of the European Community and the United States of America have increased the term of copyright for works from 50 to 70 years following the death of the author.</entry>

In Australia, only the larger film and television production companies operate music publishing subsidiaries. It is common practice for the composer of any original soundtrack music to retain the copyright in the &ldquo;musical works&rdquo; with the production company being granted a synchronisation licence either directly by the composer (see clause 4(a) of precedent &ldquo;Soundtrack composer&rsquo;s agreement&rdquo;) or from the composer&rsquo;s music publisher (see precedent &ldquo;Synchronisation licence&rdquo;).

<entry align="left" spanname="SPAN1"><?Pub _cellfont TypeSize="9pt"?>This is an agreement between a manager and a performing artist such as an actor, singer, dancer, acrobat, model or musician. The manager will advise the performing artist on the direction of their business activities in the entertainment industry.</entry>
</row>
<row>
<entry align="left" spanname="SPAN1"><?Pub _cellfont TypeSize="9pt"?>The relationship between a manager and a performing artist is one of the most sensitive that an entertainment lawyer may be called upon to put into writing. It inevitably involves a position of trust over and above fiduciary duty, yet the commercial terms of the agreement may create conflicts between the performer and manager right at the beginning of the development of that trust. It is perhaps not surprising that many of these agreements end up being on a &ldquo;handshake&rdquo; basis despite the commercial difficulties that this may create for both parties if the relationship subsequently deteriorates. Entering into a contract too early can cause legal problems if the artist loses confidence in the manager but is locked into a business relationship. It may be appropriate for the artist to start with an initial period which, by mutual agreement, can be extended. However, established managers may not wish to contract in this way as they would consider they have an established reputation and record of success as managers.</entry>
</row>
<row>
<entry align="left" spanname="SPAN1"><?Pub _cellfont TypeSize="9pt"?>New South Wales practitioners should note that the Entertainment Industry Act 1989 requires that managers be licensed by the Entertainment Industry Interim Council, administered through the NSW Department of Industrial Relations. In addition, the act provides that managers may not commission more than 10% (subject to the regulations to the act) of the performer&rsquo;s earnings unless there is a written agreement authorising a higher rate (the standard is 20%). Managers without written agreements are at risk if they are charging the higher commission</entry>

<entry align="left" spanname="SPAN2"><?Pub _cellfont TypeSize="9pt"?>The territory &mdash; most managers would resist an &ldquo;Australia-only&rdquo; provision, as the music industry is international in nature and this country only has a small (if enthusiastic) population to support it. Some managers administer all territories; others prefer to appoint sub-managers, in particular for the United States. The artist should consider the possibility of international success results in the need to base themselves in some other country. An exclusive worldwide management contract will tie the artist into a relationship with a manager who may have exceptional Australian contracts but may not be the best manager for an &ldquo;international&rdquo; artist.</entry>

Performers tend to prefer mutual agreement to extensions of the term while managers prefer to exercise options. Sometimes pre-conditions may be negotiated before the manager is able to exercise that right in order that the term is only extended if specific events occur which advance the artist&rsquo;s career, such as the signing of record or publishing contracts with a &ldquo;major&rdquo; record or publishing company or quantified increases in the artist&rsquo;s income.</entry>

<row>
<entry align="left" spanname="SPAN1"><?Pub _cellfont TypeSize="9pt"?>The fiduciary nature of the relationship between a manager and an artist can be seen in the case law of successful artists litigating with managers (and music publishers) over contracts entered into when the artist was young and naive. The UK courts have considered that the manager is in a fiduciary relationship with the artist and as a consequence of this relationship the courts have applied a number of reasons to set aside agreements which favour the interests of the manager over those of the artist: the use of undue influence; unequal bargaining power and the absence of any genuine negotiations (such as where &ldquo;standard agreements&rdquo; are offered on a &ldquo;take it or leave it basis&rdquo;); that there are unequal obligations resulting from the existence of unequal bargaining power or the failure by the artist to take independent legal advice; and the application of the doctrine of restraint of trade in relation to exclusive agreements. In <emphasis
type="ital">O&rsquo;Sullivan v Management Agency &amp; Music Ltd</emphasis> [1985] QB 428; (1984) 2 IPR 499; [1985] 3 All ER 351 the court set aside an agreement as the manager, using inequality of bargaining power, and in breach of his or her fiduciary duty, persuaded O&rsquo;Sullivan to sign publishing and recording agreements which were disadvantageous. In <emphasis
type="ital">Elton John v James</emphasis> (1991) 18 FSR 397 it was held there was a fiduciary duty and that there was a presumption of the exercise of undue influence, and inequality of bargaining power, where independent legal advice was not given to the artist.</entry>

</row>
<row>
<entry align="left" spanname="SPAN1"><?Pub _cellfont TypeSize="9pt"?>Practitioners should note that the following band agreement is structured as a partnership so that it may be appropriate to advise on the risks and potential liabilities arising under the relevant state or territory partnership legislation. While the structure of a partnership may be a low cost option for a group commencing their career, the use of a company may be preferred for groups that want to begin their career operating through a company structure, or for groups that have established themselves, so that the limited liability status can be used to manage risk, tax or other commercial issues (see clause 2).</entry>

</row>
<row>
<entry align="left" spanname="SPAN1"><?Pub _cellfont TypeSize="9pt"?>The voluntary departure of a band member is addressed in clauses 28&ndash;30; the forced departure of a band member is addressed in clauses 31&amp;32; and the death of a band member is addressed in clause 33. Note that where the band members are partners under general partnership law, any change to a partnership results in its dissolution. However, under general partnership law such a dissolution of the existing partnership does not necessarily result in the winding up of the partnership, as the remaining partners and any new partners can continue to conduct the business of the partnership as a reconstituted partnership if the conditions set out in GST Ruling GSTR 2003/13 apply to the change to the partnership. If conditions are satisfied, and the appropriate tax returns of lodged with the Australian Tax Office (<emphasis
type="bold">ATO</emphasis>) then the partnership can continue as a reconstituted partnership and the partnership will be able to use its existing ABN, TFN and GST registration. See ATO &ldquo;Changing the makeup of a partnership&rdquo; (<xref link-to="web"
xrefid="http://www.ato.gov.au/">https://www.ato.gov.au/</xref>). There are possible Capital Gains Tax implications in dealings with partnership interests including the goodwill in the partnerships.</entry>

<entry align="left" spanname="SPAN1"><?Pub _cellfont TypeSize="9pt"?>Following the departure of a band member who is a partner, the admittance of a new partner would be effected by a deed of variation between the remaining original partners and the new band member to admit that person to the partnership.</entry>

<row>
<entry align="left" spanname="SPAN1"><?Pub _cellfont TypeSize="9pt"?>In the following band agreement, decision-making procedures are addressed by choosing which decisions are to be made by a majority vote and which decisions require unanimity (see clauses 5, 6, 7 and 10).</entry>
</row>
<row>
<entry align="left" spanname="SPAN1"><?Pub _cellfont TypeSize="9pt"?>Practitioners should note that the following band agreement is drafted on the assumption that there is equality of voting power between members of the group. However, some groups may have the public perception of equality between members of the group, while in reality the group is controlled by one or some of the members. This difference in power can be addressed by redrafting the decision-making provisions, or it may be more appropriate to structure the relationship between the controlling members of the group as a partnership (using the following band agreement), or alternatively using a company with the relationship between the controlling members of the group being addressed in a shareholders&rsquo; agreement. The relationship between the controlling members and the members with limited or no decision-making power would then be covered in separate contracts to provide services to the partnership of controlling members, or to the company. Such services agreements can provide for either a salary for the group member, or revenue-sharing in relation to the various revenue streams generated by the group (or both).</entry>
</row>
<row>
<entry align="left" spanname="SPAN1"><?Pub _cellfont TypeSize="9pt"?>The division of music publishing income can cause friction between members of a group. The songwriters in a group may create songs ready for performance, including the creation of the various arrangements for the musicians in the group, and such songwriters would expect to control all the music publishing, with the writer&rsquo;s share of music publishing revenue being held by the songwriters and the publisher&rsquo;s share being assigned to the music publisher contracted by the songwriters. Other songwriters may bring incomplete songs to the group, with the other group members contributing to composition of the song to the extent that they would be considered to be&ldquo;co-authors&rdquo; of the song. </entry>

		  <emphasis type="bold">Group compositions</emphasis>
		</entry>
</row>
<row>
<entry align="left" spanname="SPAN1"><?Pub _cellfont TypeSize="9pt"?>The importance of appropriate agreements relating to group compositions is shown by the decisions in <emphasis type="ital">Fisher v Brooker</emphasis>. Some 40 years after the song &ldquo;A Whiter Shade of Pale&rdquo; was composed, former members of the band &ldquo;ProcolHarum&rdquo; litigated over the authorship of the music for the song. The court at first instance (<emphasis
type="ital">Fisher v Brooker</emphasis> [2006] EWHC 3239 (Ch)) held that Matthew Fisher was a co-author of the music for the song because of his contribution of the distinctive 8-bar introduction, which was repeated, including in a distinctive organ solo. The court held that &ldquo;the organ solo is a distinctive and significant contribution to the overall composition and, quite obviously, the product of skill and labour on the part of the person who created it&rdquo;. The court went on to assess the contribution of Matthew Fisher to the composition of the music for the song at 40%, with the contribution of Gary Brooker being 60%. (Keith Reid continues to be credited as the sole composer of the lyrics of the song). The Court of Appeal (<emphasis
type="ital">Brooker v Fisher</emphasis> [2008] EWCA Civ 287) confirmed the contribution of authorship of Matthew Fisher although the majority over-ruled the declaration as to Matthew Fisher having a property interest in the song and a right to income from exploitation of the copyright in the song. The House of Lord (<emphasis
type="ital">Fisher v Brooker</emphasis> [2009] All ER (D) 338; [2009] UKHL 41 (30 July 2009)) reinstated the declarations of the judge at first instance, with the declarations having the effect that Matthew Fisher is recognised as owning 40% of the copyright of the musical work, with an entitlement to future income from the exploitation of &ldquo;A Whiter Shade of Pale&rdquo;.</entry>
</row>
<row>
<entry align="left" spanname="SPAN1"><?Pub _cellfont TypeSize="9pt"?>The Court of Appeal recommended that written assignments be obtained from performers to cover arrangements of music that they have improvised and so created new copyright works during rehearsal or recording sessions so that there is certainty about the ownership of the rights necessary for the exploitation of the copyright. However, achieving certainty as to ownership of musical works should be done in ways that acknowledge that it is for the musicians to take responsibility for deciding whether they are engaged in joint composition of a song and to recognise what is a &ldquo;substantial&rdquo; contribution to a song, with the musicians then deciding what are the appropriate ownership and income sharing arrangements for the jointly composed song. A blanked assignment of copyright in improvisations may be justified where session musicians are engaged for recording film and television soundtracks (see precedent Soundtrack composer&rsquo;s agreement &mdash; Annexure A &mdash; Musician&rsquo;s release). However, care will need to be taken to ensure that the assignment of copyright of the improvisations is to the primary composer(s) so as to avoid fragmenting the ownership of the musical work, such as would happen if the assignment is to an entity that does not otherwise have an interest on the copyright of the musical work.</entry>
</row>
<row>
<entry align="left" spanname="SPAN1"><?Pub _cellfont TypeSize="9pt"?>Where band members are employees of a company an assignment of arrangements and other contributions to the composition of songs would be appropriate (see precedent Session musician&rsquo;s release). In this band agreement contributions to the composition of songs are dealt by requiring band members to make a claim to authorship within the procedures described in clauses 18 to 20.</entry>

		  <emphasis type="bold">Division of revenue</emphasis>
		</entry>
</row>
<row>
<entry align="left" spanname="SPAN1"><?Pub _cellfont TypeSize="9pt"?>Where all group members contribute equally to the composition of the music and the writing of the lyrics, then an equal division may be appropriate. However the reality may be that not all group members contribute to the writing of the songs, in which case a better approach may be to have song-writing credits attributed to the group members who do contribute to the writing of each song, so that the song-writing talent in the group receives the writer&rsquo;s share of the income generated from their compositions (see clauses 17 and 18).</entry>
</row>
<row>
<entry align="left" spanname="SPAN1"><?Pub _cellfont TypeSize="9pt"?>In dividing up the music publishing revenue, the creative contribution of lead vocalists or lead musicians may need to be considered. These group members may consider they make a significant contribution to the song in the recording studio, in that their performance brings value to a composition, for which they are not compensated out of the music publishing revenue. Clause 19 allows members of the group to agree to allocate &ldquo;co-authorship&rdquo; credits, which would include stating all co-authors when the relevant forms are registered with the Australasian Performing Right Association Ltd (<emphasis
type="bold">APRA</emphasis>) (<xref link-to="web" xrefid="http://apraamcos.com.au">http://apraamcos.com.au</xref>). However, in order to limit litigation over &ldquo;co-authorship&rdquo;, clause 20 requires a member of the group to make a claim of being a &ldquo;co-author&rdquo; within two years, and if a claim of &ldquo;co-authorship&rdquo; is not made then the APRA forms are deemed to establish the songwriter credits.</entry>
</row>
<row>
<entry align="left" spanname="SPAN1"><?Pub _cellfont TypeSize="9pt"?>The ability of members of the group to have a &ldquo;solo&rdquo; career at the same time as being a member of the group should be worked out between the members of the group, and, if the group is signed to a record company, the recording agreement is likely to contain exclusivity commitments, so that the record company may have approval rights over group members either performing in live performances with other artists or engaging in recording sessions with other artists (see clauses 21 to 23).</entry>
</row>
<row>
<entry align="left" spanname="SPAN1">
		  <?Pub _cellfont TypeSize="9pt"?>
		  <emphasis type="bold">Group name</emphasis>
		</entry>
</row>
<row>
<entry align="left" spanname="SPAN1"><?Pub _cellfont TypeSize="9pt"?>The control of the group name and the &ldquo;goodwill&rdquo; in the name needs to be managed, given that groups may have members departing or forced to leave, with the risk of different formulations of the group operating under the same or similar names. Clause 24 keeps the control of the name of the group with the remaining majority of the members of the group. The departure of group members needs to be considered, whether the departure is voluntary, forced or as a consequence of death (see clauses 28 to 33). The following band agreement deals with the consequences of departure of group members by confirming their entitlement to revenue generated during their membership of the group (see clause 34), and distinguishing between the entitlement to be paid a share of the tangible assets of the group and the intangible assets of the group (see clause 35). The valuation of intangible assets, such as the &ldquo;goodwill&rdquo; in the name of the group, can create difficult valuation issues, so the following band agreement simply provides that the remaining members of the group retain the benefit of the intangible assets. Such an approach may not be appropriate where a group has an established reputation so that the band name has a considerable value, such as in the use of the name for generating merchandising revenue.</entry>
</row>
<row>
<entry align="left" spanname="SPAN1"><?Pub _cellfont TypeSize="9pt"?>The payment in instalments of the share of the physical, tangible assets of the group is to avoid the continuing members being forced to pay, what may be a significant amount, in one lump sum.</entry>
</row>
<row>
<entry align="left" spanname="SPAN1"><?Pub _cellfont TypeSize="9pt"?>If group members are less than 18 years of age, practitioners should take account of the relevant state or territory law relating to contracts involving minors, and the circumstances in which they can reject contracts.</entry>

Mummery LJ commented &ldquo;in future record and publishing companies might be well advised to obtain assignments in writing from performers to cover arrangements of music that may have improvised and so created new copyright works during rehearsal or recording sessions that are not covered by earlier formal agreements.&rdquo; <emphasis
type="ital">Fisher v Brooker</emphasis> [2009] UKHL 41 reinstated the decision of the judge at first instance; that Matthew Fisher is recognised as a co-author of the musical work &ldquo;A Whiter Shade of Pale&rdquo;. Clause 6 of the Musician&rsquo;s release assigns to the composer the copyright in any new copyrighted work the musician may create during rehearsal or recording sessions such as arrangements or improvisations of music. This is based on the assumption that the composer holds the copyright in the musical works so that the composer can deal with the copyright in the musical works in accordance with any music publishing agreement related to the compositions.</entry>

<row>
<entry align="left" spanname="SPAN1"><?Pub _cellfont TypeSize="9pt"?>The <emphasis type="ital">Fisher v Brooker </emphasis> problem is of primary concern to composers and music publishers as relates to the uncertainty as to ownership of musical works and the allocation of revenue from the exploitation of the musical works.</entry>
</row>
<row>
<entry align="left" spanname="SPAN1"><?Pub _cellfont TypeSize="9pt"?>If this problem is to be addressed in a session musician&rsquo;s agreement then care will need to be taken to avoid fragmenting the ownership of the musical work, such as would happen if an assignment of the copyright in any improvisations or arrangements of a musical work is to an entity that does not otherwise have an interest on the copyright of the musical work. Many engagements of sessions musicians are by record companies and other &ldquo;producers&rdquo; so that it is not appropriate to attempt to address the <emphasis
type="ital">Fisher v Brooker </emphasis> problem by an assignment of a contribution to the composition of a musical work during rehearsal or recording sessions as that will fragment ownership of the musical work between the record company and the composer(s) and music publisher(s). If the &ldquo;producer&rdquo; engaging the session musicians is not the composer(s) or music publisher(s), then the better approach may be not to deal with the <emphasis

</row>
<row>
<entry align="left" spanname="SPAN1"><?Pub _cellfont TypeSize="9pt"?>This precedent is an agreement between a songwriter or composer of music works and a company or other legal entity that will manage the exploitation of the copyright in the musical works (the &ldquo;music publisher&rdquo;).</entry>
</row>
<row>
<entry align="left" spanname="SPAN1"><?Pub _cellfont TypeSize="9pt"?>Music publishers&rsquo; contract with composers of &ldquo;musical works&rdquo; (as defined under copyright law) and with the lyricists (the lyrics being a &ldquo;literary work&rdquo; as defined under copyright law). The primary role of the music publisher is to promote the songs to record companies and recording artists to record &ldquo;cover versions&rdquo; of the songs, and for use of the songs in the soundtrack of film and television productions. A publisher may have a large catalogue on certain genres of music but less strong in other genres. Therefore, a factor in the choice of what publisher is better, for an artist, may turn on the compatibility with the genre of music of the composers and songwriters and the strength of the publisher in promoting that genre of music. The organisation and management of music publishing revenue are covered in specialist books which may be of assistance in understanding the role of music publishers and the management of music publishing revenue. An aspect of music publishing is the management of public performance revenue. The public performance licensing entity in Australia (which is affiliated to public performance collection agencies in other countries), is the Australasian Performing Right Association Ltd (<emphasis
type="bold">APRA</emphasis>) (<xref link-to="web" xrefid="http://apraamcos.com.au">http://apraamcos.com.au</xref>).</entry>
</row>
<row>
<entry align="left" spanname="SPAN1"><?Pub _cellfont TypeSize="9pt"?>Composers and songwriters become members of APRA and assign APRA the copyright relevant to the collection of public performance revenue. Music publishers can also register with APRA in order to access the &ldquo;publisher&rsquo;s share&rdquo; of the public performance revenue. Music publishing agreements are sent to APRA for the purpose of APRA managing the public performance revenue and dividing the revenue into the &ldquo;writer&rsquo;s share&rdquo; and the &ldquo;publisher&rsquo;s share&rdquo;. APRA&rsquo;s membership rules should be consulted in relation to the treatment of the &ldquo;writer&rsquo;s share&rdquo; and the &ldquo;publisher&rsquo;s share&rdquo; as between the songwriter and the music publisher. APRA membership rules also provide for minimum requirements for membership as a publisher member.</entry>

</row>
<row>
<entry align="left" spanname="SPAN1"><?Pub _cellfont TypeSize="9pt"?>Some composers seek commissions from film and television producers to compose the &ldquo;underscore&rdquo; music for a soundtrack. A soundtrack composer who also has a career as a songwriter may want to exclude the soundtrack compositions from clause 1.1 in order to be able to deal with the music publishing for the underscore with the film and television producer as some producer&rsquo;s wish to have access to the music publishing revenue of the music they commissioned. However, this practice is not universal and the licence to synchronise the music composed under the film/tv composer&rsquo;s agreement may be licensed from the music publisher to whom the composer is exclusively contracted.</entry>
</row>
<row>
<entry align="left" spanname="SPAN1"><?Pub _cellfont TypeSize="9pt"?>In the case of performing groups a publisher may sign all members in case some exhibit songwriting talents at a later stage in their career. The division of music publishing income between members of a band can cause friction between band members. Where all band members equally contribute to composing the music and the writing of the lyrics, then an equal division is appropriate. However, the reality is that songwriting talent is unequal with members so that a better approach may be to have songwriting credits attributed to the contributions to each song, so that the songwriting talent in the band receive the writer&rsquo;s share of the income generated from their compositions. However, in dividing up the music publishing revenue the creative contribution of lead vocalists or lead musicians may need to be considered. These band members may consider they make a significant contribution to the song in the recording studio, in that their performance brings value to a composition, for which they are not compensated out of the music publishing revenue. A separate agreement between the band members may be the appropriate place to deal with the organisation of the band including the equitable division of income for all sources.</entry>

<entry align="left" spanname="SPAN1"><?Pub _cellfont TypeSize="9pt"?>The importance of appropriate agreements relating to music compositions is shown by the decisions in <emphasis type="ital">Fisher v Brooker</emphasis>. The problem identified in <emphasis
type="ital">Brooker v Fisher</emphasis> [2008] EWCA Civ 287 [105]. Mummery LJ commented &ldquo;[i]n future record and publishing companies might be well advised to obtain assignments in writing from performers to cover arrangements of music that may have improvised and so created new copyright works during rehearsal or recording sessions that are not covered by earlier formal agreements.&rdquo; <emphasis
type="ital">Fisher v Brooker</emphasis> [2009] UKHL 41 reinstated the decision of the judge at first instance; that Matthew Fisher is recognised as a co-author of the musical work &ldquo;A Whiter Shade of Pale&rdquo;.</entry>

</row>
<row>
<entry align="left" spanname="SPAN1"><?Pub _cellfont TypeSize="9pt"?>The problem for the publisher is that it has the relationship with the writer (through the publishing agreement) and it is the writer who chooses to collaborate with other songwriters and musicians. The purpose of clause 3.3 of this agreement is to put the onus on the writer to document the ownership and the allocation of writers&rsquo; shares of a joint composition song including those contributions to a song which may be made by a musician during rehearsals and recording sessions.</entry>
</row>
<row>
<entry align="left" spanname="SPAN1"><?Pub _cellfont TypeSize="9pt"?>Care will need to be taken to ensure that the assignment of copyright of the improvisations is to the primary composer(s) so as to avoid fragmenting the ownership of the musical work, such as would happen if the assignment is to an entity that does not otherwise have an interest on the copyright of the musical work). In the precedent &ldquo;Session musician&rsquo;s release&rdquo;, clause 6 assigns to the composer the copyright in any new copyrighted work the musician may create during rehearsal or recording sessions such as arrangements or improvisations of music. This is based on the assumption that the composer holds the copyright in the musical works so that the composer can deal with the copyright in the musical works in accordance with any music publishing agreement related to the compositions.</entry>
</row>
<row>
<entry align="left" spanname="SPAN1"><?Pub _cellfont TypeSize="9pt"?>The three main forms of music publishing agreement are:</entry>
</row>
<row>
<entry align="center"><?Pub _cellfont TypeSize="9pt"?>&bull;</entry>
<entry align="left" spanname="SPAN2"><?Pub _cellfont TypeSize="9pt"?>An administration agreement &mdash; where the songwriter retains all of the copyrights and the publisher is licensed to collect the earnings from uses of the song, principally from performing and mechanical rights. These would normally result in a 90/10 deal in favour of the writer.</entry>
</row>
<row>
<entry align="center"><?Pub _cellfont TypeSize="9pt"?>&bull;</entry>
<entry align="left" spanname="SPAN2"><?Pub _cellfont TypeSize="9pt"?>A co-publishing agreement &mdash; the copyrights are owned by the writer and publisher equally as tenants-in-common, with the publisher having full rights of exploitation, that is, to actively publish the songs rather than merely collect the earnings.</entry>
</row>
<row>
<entry align="center"><?Pub _cellfont TypeSize="9pt"?><?Pub _cellfont TypeSize="9pt"?>&bull;</entry>
<entry align="left" spanname="SPAN2"><?Pub _cellfont TypeSize="9pt"?>An assignment agreement &mdash; the copyrights are assigned in full to the publisher, which therefore has all the rights available to an owner. The writer seeks to set limits on the publisher&rsquo;s rights (for example, in respect of commercial endorsements) but otherwise has few rights other than to receive earnings. This is a common arrangement in Australia, with rates generally being 70/30 or 80/20 in favour of the writer.</entry>
</row>
<row>
<?PubTbl row rht="0.34in"?>
<entry align="left" spanname="SPAN1">

		  <emphasis type="bold">Sub-publishing arrangements</emphasis>
		</entry>
</row>
<row>
<entry align="left" spanname="SPAN1"><?Pub _cellfont TypeSize="9pt"?>Lawyers should note that many publishers have sub-publishing arrangements to facilitate the collection of income. This leaves the local publisher free to assist in the development of the writer&rsquo;s songs but also means that the writer will not be receiving a percentage of the true gross income (only the &ldquo;amounts actually received by the publisher&rdquo;). A condition should be established that not more than say 15% or 20% of gross income may be commissioned by a foreign sub-publisher. (If the writer receives 80% of the publisher&rsquo;s share, and the publisher receives 80% of gross foreign income, then the writer is effectively only receiving 64% from that source.)</entry>
</row>
<row>
<entry align="left" spanname="SPAN1"><?Pub _cellfont TypeSize="9pt"?>Also note that some lawyers take a strict view that publishers should not be entitled to a share of income from performing rights as this is not a form of exploitation that a publisher is able to control (on the basis that publishers have little or no influence on what songs are played on radio or jukeboxes). It is unlikely that any publisher would accept this submission, mainly for commercial reasons, but also because one form of exploitation may be providing support to other forms of use.</entry>
</row>
<row>
<entry align="left" spanname="SPAN1"><?Pub _cellfont TypeSize="9pt"?>It is the nature of the music industry that a number of songwriters are young. Contracting with young songwriters should take account of the effect of state and territory legislation on contracting with minors and the circumstances in which they can reject contracts.</entry>
</row>
<row>
<entry align="left" spanname="SPAN1">
		  <?Pub _cellfont TypeSize="9pt"?>
		  <emphasis type="bold">Relationship between a publisher and composer or songwriter</emphasis>
		</entry>
</row>
<row>
<entry align="left" spanname="SPAN1"><?Pub _cellfont TypeSize="9pt"?>The relationship between a publisher and composer or songwriter may involve a position of trust leading to fiduciary duties, yet the commercial terms of the agreement may create conflicts between the composer/songwriter and publisher right at the beginning of the development of that trust. Entering into a contract too early can cause legal problems if the composer/songwriter loses confidence in the publisher but is locked into a business relationship.</entry>
</row>
<row>
<entry align="left" spanname="SPAN1"><?Pub _cellfont TypeSize="9pt"?>The fiduciary nature of the relationship between a music publisher (or manager) and an artist can be seen in the case law of successful artists litigating with music publishers (and managers) over contracts entered into when the artist was young and naive. The UK courts have considered that the publisher is in a fiduciary relationship with the artist and as a consequence of this relationship the courts have applied a number of reasons to set aside agreements which favour the interests of the manager over those of the artist: the use of undue influence; unequal bargaining power and the absence of any genuine negotiations (such as where &ldquo;standard agreements&rdquo; are offered on a &ldquo;take it or leave it basis&rdquo;); that there are unequal obligations resulting from the existence of unequal bargaining power or the failure by the artist to take independent legal advice; and the application of the doctrine of restraint of trade in relation to exclusive agreements. </entry>
</row>
<row>
<entry align="left" spanname="SPAN1"><?Pub _cellfont TypeSize="9pt"?>There are a number of instances where UK courts have found publishing agreements unenforceable: <emphasis type="ital">Elton John v James</emphasis> (1991) 18 FSR 397 - held there was a fiduciary duty and that there was a presumption of the exercise of undue influence, and inequality of bargaining power, where independent legal advice was not given to the artist: <emphasis
type="ital">Zang Tumb Tum Records Ltd &amp; Perfect Songs v Johnson</emphasis> [1993] EMLR 61. Zang Tumb Tum sought injunctions to prevent Holly Johnson breaking his exclusive recording and publishing agreements related to the band (Frankie Goes to Hollywood). The court held that the recording agreement was not a fair bargain and breached the restraint of trade doctrine and the publishing agreement was interpreted to be limited to &ldquo;group&rdquo; compositions and not to compositions by Holly Johnson as an individual songwriter.</entry>

<row>
<entry align="left" spanname="SPAN1"><?Pub _cellfont TypeSize="9pt"?>The recording agreement is probably the most hotly negotiated contract in the entertainment industry. It is often appropriate for the negotiations to commence on a document commonly referred to as a &ldquo;deal memo&rdquo; which sets out the principal commercial elements of the proposed agreement. These elements normally include the number of options and albums required, the territory, the advances and the royalty rates. The drafting of a &ldquo;deal memo&rdquo; will have to take account of whether it is to act as a &ldquo;letter of intent&rdquo; or a binding agreement. In some cases, the music company will ask the artist to sign a short-form recording contract once the deal memo has been agreed to ensure that the artist cannot continue negotiations elsewhere while the remaining terms are settled. The decision will have to be made as to whether it is appropriate to sign a &ldquo;short-form&rdquo; agreement, or to move straight to the &ldquo;long-form&rdquo; agreement. Artist&rsquo;s, with managers, are likely to look to the manager for advice on this matter as it is likely that the manager has facilitated the offer from the music company.</entry>

<entry align="left" spanname="SPAN1"><?Pub _cellfont TypeSize="9pt"?>In Australia, the great majority of signings (it has been estimated at up to 90%) are with so-called &ldquo;independent labels&rdquo;. This expression means that the sound-recordings will be released under the &ldquo;label&rdquo; of that company, and the performers will have their principal &ldquo;artist and repertoire&rdquo; (A&amp;R) relationship with the owner/operator of the company. However, all but the very smallest or newest have a distribution agreement with a so-called &ldquo;major&rdquo; record company. All of the majors in Australia are presently foreign-owned and manufacture and distribute virtually all records sound recordings sold in this country.</entry>

<entry align="left" spanname="SPAN1"><?Pub _cellfont TypeSize="9pt"?>The impact of digital delivery of music and falling sales of CDs has resulted in recording industry business models evolving, with some music industry companies moving from offering traditional recording contracts, (which focus on recording and exploitation of copyright in sound-recordings) to so-called &ldquo;360&deg; Contracts&rdquo; in which the music company also involved in financing the touring of the artist, participates in merchandising revenue and with some artists, the music company provides management services to represent the artist in respect to their acting talent).

Music companies operating worldwide through related companies may offer a world-wide royalty-based deal, although there may be different royalties paid outside of Australia &amp; New Zealand. Independent labels tend to licence the master so that the offer to the artist for territories outside Australia &amp; New Zealand may be based on a percentage of the master licence fee.</entry>

Some music companies even require say three albums locally, but if a foreign recording agreement is obtained then the Australian term will extend to the term of the foreign contract. As albums tend to be delivered every 18 to 24 months, a period of 10 to 15 years of the artist&rsquo;s career may be involved.</entry>

<entry align="left" spanname="SPAN2"><?Pub _cellfont TypeSize="9pt"?>Advances (clause 10) &mdash; some top-line performers may be able to negotiate a &ldquo;sign-on&rdquo; advance in addition to the advances for the actual recording budget. In rare instances, this sign-on advance may be non-recoupable. Note that advances (including all recording costs) are recouped from the artist&rsquo;s royalties, although the artist only rarely can negotiate to become the owner of the masters upon recoupment (copyright would usually remain with the company as the &ldquo;maker&rdquo; as defined in the Copyright Act). The music company bears the initial investment together with manufacturing, distribution, promotion and administration expenses. Advances are usually recoupable from the royalties generated from the sound recordings. Despite high retail sales of sound recordings, royalties will not flow to the artist until the advances are recovered by the record company. Note that the music company is recovering the advances out of the artist&rsquo;s &ldquo;share&rdquo; of revenue as the recoupment of the advances is made out of any money due to the artist from the record company.</entry>

<entry align="left" spanname="SPAN2"><?Pub _cellfont TypeSize="9pt"?>Royalties (clause 11) &mdash; music companies make offers with a &ldquo;royalty cost base&rdquo;, which is usually based on the &ldquo;recommended retail price&rdquo; (RRP) less specified deductions. The interpretation of the royalty clauses will determine how much money the artist receives from the sale of CDs and other media (following recoupment by the music company of the advances described in clause 10). The royalty in clause 11 cannot be read in isolation to the following clauses 12 and 13, as the subsequent clauses effectively reduce the base on which royalty percentages are calculated. There are variations between the &ldquo;royalty cost base&rdquo; used by music companies, so that if two deals are being offered to an artist, then careful (and expert) analysis may be necessary to work out which is the better deal. The rates are subject to numerous variations according to the negotiations of both parties, with one common variation being an increase in the royalties paid on a per-album basis. Rates may be deliberately low during the early &ldquo;development&rdquo; albums, which then accelerate as the artists&rsquo; popularity or longevity continues.</entry>

<entry align="left" spanname="SPAN2"><?Pub _cellfont TypeSize="9pt"?>Royalty rate reductions (clause 12) &mdash; these often appear unfair but are the result of common practices within the music industry and are rarely negotiable items. Reductions also commonly apply during the introduction of new technologies and formats (while the music companies recoup their hardware development costs at the expense of the artists) and could lead to long-term inequities if the rates do not return to full-rate when the format becomes relatively common. It is not so long ago that compact discs were a new format with reduced rates; sales of CDs now dominate &ldquo;records&rdquo; sold in Australia although online delivery of music files has overtaken CD sales.</entry>

They are often countries with weak or no copyright laws, and the music company would be looking to receive the highest possible fees. Note that it stands to lose at the same rate as the artist, so flat-fee licences are not likely to be given lightly.</entry>

Note that the percentage often bears no relationship to the actual packaging costs and so must be carefully monitored to avoid unnecessary reductions of the artist&rsquo;s income (or at least its ability to recoup the costs).</entry>

<entry align="left" spanname="SPAN2"><?Pub _cellfont TypeSize="9pt"?>Record and video budgets (schedule 1) &mdash; these are normally calculated between the music company and the artist&rsquo;s manager. Ideally the first recording budget should allow for the legal fees incurred in negotiating the recording agreement, although this is frequently rejected. If so, it would increase the grounds for seeking a sign-on advance, whether recoupable or not. Note that managers should not be entitled to commission the whole of the recording budget, but only the performers&rsquo; payments, if at all. Computers and the Internet have created both risks and opportunities for recording artists and music companies. The ability of Internet users to copy and transmit sound recordings should eventually be managed by a combination of technological safeguards, legislative change and litigation against those facilitating unauthorised copying of sound recordings. Recording agreements may continue to refer to old storage media, such as &ldquo;LPs&rdquo; and &ldquo;singles&rdquo; as a small market for vinyl records still exists in the club/DJ market. Clearly the major delivery media are the CD (for audio material) and CD-ROM and DVD (for audio and audiovisual material); with Internet delivery of songs and &ldquo;video clips&rdquo; now overtaking CDs in importance. Thus, recording agreements may address Internet delivery, with royalty rates a point of negotiation. Until the point in time at which revenue losses due to unauthorised copying of sound recordings is minimised, artists may need to consider the impact the Internet will have on their careers. Artists may also need to consider whether the Internet provides an opportunity to reach an audience with the main source of revenue to the artist being the income generated from performances and tour merchandising or whether the sale of sound recordings is to be the main source of income, with royalty clauses being of significant effect. Royalty rates for songs downloading from Web sites may require negotiation.</entry>

<entry align="left" spanname="SPAN2"><?Pub _cellfont TypeSize="9pt"?>It is the nature of the music industry that a number of artists are young. Contracting with young artists should take account of the effect of state and territory legislation on contracting with minors and the circumstances in which they can reject contracts. Recording artists have litigated with music companies over contracts entered into when the artist was young and naive. The level of success of the artists in litigation in the UK is a warning in relation to the extent to which these types of contracts can, or should, favour the interests of the music company over those of the artist. The relationship between an artist and a music company may involve a position of trust leading to fiduciary duties. (See notes to precedent Media and entertainment management agreement). There are a number of instances where UK courts have found recording agreements unenforceable: <emphasis
type="ital">Zang Tumb Tum Records Ltd &amp; Perfect Songs v Johnson</emphasis> [1993] EMLR 61. Zang Tumb Tum sought injunctions to prevent Holly Johnson breaking his exclusive recording and publishing agreements related to the band (Frankie Goes to Hollywood). The court held that the recording agreement was not a fair bargain and breached the restraint of trade doctrine.</entry>

It is often appropriate for the negotiations to commence on a document commonly referred to as a &ldquo;deal memo&rdquo; which sets out the principal commercial elements of the proposed agreement. These elements normally include the number of options and albums required, the territory, the advances and the royalty rates. The drafting of a &ldquo;deal memo&rdquo; will have to take account of whether it is to act as a &ldquo;letter of intent&rdquo; or a binding agreement. In some cases, the music company will ask the artist to sign a short-form recording contract once the deal memo has been agreed to ensure that the artist cannot continue negotiations elsewhere while the remaining terms are settled. The decision will have to be made as to whether it is appropriate to sign a &ldquo;short-form&rdquo; agreement, or to move straight to the &ldquo;long-form&rdquo; agreement. Artist&rsquo;s, with managers, are likely to look to the manager for advice on this matter as it is likely that the manager has facilitated the offer from the music company.</entry>

<entry align="left" spanname="SPAN1"><?Pub _cellfont TypeSize="9pt"?>In Australia, the great majority of signings (it has been estimated at up to 90%) are with so-called &ldquo;independent labels&rdquo;. This expression means that the sound-recordings will be released under the &ldquo;label&rdquo; of that company, and the performers will have their principal &ldquo;artist and repertoire&rdquo; (A&amp;R) relationship with the owner/operator of the company. However, all but the very smallest or newest have a distribution agreement with a so-called &ldquo;major&rdquo; record company. All of the majors in Australia are presently foreign-owned and manufacture and distribute virtually all records sound recordings sold in this country.</entry>

<entry align="left" spanname="SPAN1"><?Pub _cellfont TypeSize="9pt"?>The following recording agreement is a net-profit deal, which a small independent recording company (an &ldquo;indie&rdquo; label) may choose to use rather than the royalties-based model that is used by the &ldquo;major&rdquo; record companies (see precedent &ldquo;Recording agreement (royalty-based)&rdquo;). The royalties-based model provides for royalties paid at different rates in respect to the release of sound recordings on different media, with royalty rates are subject to variations and reductions. The calculation of royalties in a royalties-based model can be complicated. The net-profit model can provide a simpler, more transparent deal for both the &ldquo;indie&rdquo; label and bands signed to the label.</entry>

<entry align="left" spanname="SPAN2"><?Pub _cellfont TypeSize="9pt"?>Territory (clause 2) &mdash; almost all labels require world rights. This is because the return from the Australian music-buying population is often not sufficient to recover the recording costs, so that the music company would intend to distribute the sound-recordings in the world market through related companies or licensees. Music companies operating worldwide through related companies may offer a world-wide royalties-based deal, although there may be different royalties paid outside of Australia &amp; New Zealand. Independent labels tend to licence the master so that the offer to the artist for territories outside Australia &amp; New Zealand may be based on a percentage of the master licence fee.</entry>

Some music companies even require say three albums locally, but if a foreign recording agreement is obtained then the Australian term will extend to the term of the foreign contract. As albums tend to be delivered every 18 to 24 months, a period of 10 to 15 years of the artist&rsquo;s career may be involved.</entry>

<entry align="left" spanname="SPAN2"><?Pub _cellfont TypeSize="9pt"?>Advances (clause 10) &mdash; some top-line performers may be able to negotiate a &ldquo;sign-on&rdquo; advance in addition to the advances for the actual recording budget. In rare instances, this sign-on advance may be non-recoupable. Note that advances (including all recording costs) are recouped from the artist&rsquo;s royalties, although the artist only rarely can negotiate to become the owner of the masters upon recoupment (copyright would usually remain with the company as the &ldquo;maker&rdquo; as defined in the Copyright Act). The music company bears the initial investment together with manufacturing, distribution, promotion and administration expenses. Advances are usually recoupable from the royalties generated from the sound recordings. Despite high retail sales of sound recordings, royalties will not flow to the artist until the advances are recovered by the record company. Note that the music company is recovering the advances out of the artist&rsquo;s &ldquo;share&rdquo; of revenue as the recoupment of the advances is made out of any money due to the artist from the record company.</entry>

<entry align="left" spanname="SPAN2"><?Pub _cellfont TypeSize="9pt"?>Flat-fee licences (clause 12.2) &mdash; these are usually entered into for countries where it is difficult to expect ongoing royalty payments. They are often countries with weak or no copyright laws, and the music company would be looking to receive the highest possible fees. Note that it stands to lose at the same rate as the artist, so flat-fee licences are not likely to be given lightly.</entry>

<entry align="left" spanname="SPAN2"><?Pub _cellfont TypeSize="9pt"?>Record and video budgets (item 3 of schedule 1) &mdash; these are normally calculated between the music company and the artist&rsquo;s manager. Note that managers should not be entitled to commission the whole of the recording budget, but only the performers&rsquo; payments, if at all. Computers and the Internet have created both risks and opportunities for recording artists and music companies. The ability of Internet users to copy and transmit sound recordings should eventually be managed by a combination of technological safeguards, legislative change and litigation against those facilitating unauthorised copying of sound recordings. Recording agreements may continue to refer to old storage media, such as &ldquo;LPs&rdquo; and &ldquo;singles&rdquo; as a small market for vinyl records still exists in the club/DJ market. Clearly the major delivery media are the CD (for audio material) and CD-ROM and DVD (for audio and audiovisual material), with Internet delivery of songs and &ldquo;video clips&rdquo; now overtaking CDs in importance. Therefore, recording agreements may address Internet delivery, with royalty rates a point of negotiation. Until the point in time at which revenue losses due to unauthorised copying of sound recordings is minimised, artists may need to consider the impact the Internet will have on their careers. Artists may also need to consider whether the Internet provides an opportunity to reach an audience with the main source of revenue to the artist being the income generated from performances and tour merchandising or whether the sale of sound recordings is to be the main source of income, with royalty clauses being of significant effect. Royalty rates for songs downloading from web sites may require negotiation.</entry>

<entry align="left" spanname="SPAN2"><?Pub _cellfont TypeSize="9pt"?>It is the nature of the music industry that a number of artists are young. Contracting with young artists should take account of the effect of state and territory legislation on contracting with minors and the circumstances in which they can reject contracts. Recording artists have litigated with music companies over contracts entered into when the artist was young and naive. The level of success of the artists in litigation in the UK is a warning in relation to the extent to which these types of contracts can, or should, favour the interests of the music company over those of the artist. The relationship between an artist and a music company may involve a position of trust leading to fiduciary duties. (See notes to precedent &ldquo;Management Agreement&rdquo;). There are a number of instances where UK courts have found recording agreements unenforceable: <emphasis
type="ital">Zang Tumb Tum Records Ltd &amp; Perfect Songs v Johnson</emphasis> [1993] EMLR 61. Zang Tumb Tum sought injunctions to prevent Holly Johnson breaking his exclusive recording and publishing agreements related to the band (Frankie Goes to Hollywood). The court held that the recording agreement was not a fair bargain and breached the restraint of trade doctrine.</entry>

<entry align="left" spanname="SPAN1"><?Pub _cellfont TypeSize="9pt"?>Despite the &ldquo;star quality&rdquo; of the parties, the presenter agreement is really no more than a refined service agreement.

Appropriate amendments will need to be made if the presenter uses a service company to loan out their services, these have been indicated in the precedent below and clause 14 for GST provisions. PAYG tax will be deducted under the presenter&rsquo;s agreement unless there is a bona fide basis on which the presenter is entitled to be paid as an &ldquo;independent contractor&rdquo;. <xref

Lesser known acts would often be required to indemnify the station for the consequences of defamatory statements (which should be of most concern in live-to-air broadcasts) despite most broadcasters having insurance in any event. Star performers may well have premiums paid on their behalf, especially if they are both talented and controversial. There are a number of awards which might potentially apply to presenters covered by the standard form presenters&rsquo; agreement. The award coverage of a particular employee will depend, however, upon the exact nature of that employee&rsquo;s duties. The Broadcast and Recorded Entertainment Award 2010 includes announcers, journalists and broadcasters. Information about the award is found of the websites of the MEAA and the Fair Work Commission <xref

</row>
<row>
<entry align="left" spanname="SPAN1"><?Pub _cellfont TypeSize="9pt"?>This precedent is an agreement between a production company and the owner of the copyright in a literary work (eg novel) or dramatic work (eg screenplay).</entry>
</row>
<row>
<entry align="left" spanname="SPAN1"><?Pub _cellfont TypeSize="9pt"?>Television programs such as dramas, series and serials, or game shows normally go through a process of development before they end up in their final form. A short version is often produced which is approximately 10 minutes in duration and referred to as a &ldquo;pilot&rdquo;. Sometimes a pilot is produced as a full-length episode and may comprise the first program broadcast if it is subsequently accepted by a television network.</entry>
</row>
<row>
<entry align="left" spanname="SPAN1"><?Pub _cellfont TypeSize="9pt"?>As a result, the producer&rsquo;s contractual documentation will acquire an option over the concept (a nebulous term for legal purposes, but usually evidenced by outlines, drafts and treatments which satisfy the requirement that a &ldquo;literary work&rdquo; will be subject to protection by copyright law). A &ldquo;format&rdquo; for a game show may fail to satisfy the requirement of a &ldquo;literary work&rdquo; so that copyright law gives no effective protection for the basic framework of a dramatic format: see <emphasis
type="ital">Green v Broadcasting Corp of New Zealand</emphasis> [1989] 2 All ER 1056, <emphasis type="ital">Nine Films and Television Pty Ltd v Ninox Television Ltd</emphasis> (2005) 67 IPR 46; (2006) AIPC 92-141; [2005] FCA 1404; BC200507421. The law of confidential information serves to protect the &ldquo;ideas&rdquo; to the extent principles of equity recognises that it may be unconscionable for a recipient of confidential information to misuse that information: see <emphasis
type="ital">Talbot v General Television Corp Pty Ltd</emphasis> [1980] VR 224.</entry>
</row>
<row>
<entry align="left" spanname="SPAN1">

		  <emphasis type="bold">Option agreement</emphasis>
		</entry>
</row>
<row>
<entry align="left" spanname="SPAN1"><?Pub _cellfont TypeSize="9pt"?>The option will permit the producer to create a pilot, together with the authority to negotiate with a television network for a broadcast licence agreement. If accepted by the station&rsquo;s programming director, the producer will exercise the option and the full assignment will take effect. It is common for the assignment to be pre-signed and held by the producer&rsquo;s solicitor in escrow, with authority to date the document when it takes effect. The alternative is that the grantor has the contractual obligation to sign the assignment immediately upon delivery of the notice that the option is being exercised by the producer.</entry>
</row>
<row>
<entry align="left" spanname="SPAN1"><?Pub _cellfont TypeSize="9pt"?>As the option effectively takes the concept out of the market, the option fee represents the consideration for the exclusive option granted to the producer. The option fee may be a notional amount, or a signification sum in respect of concepts for which the producer had to compete against rival offers. The length of the option, and any extensions to the options (and option extension fees) are also negotiable (one year plus one extra year is acceptable in most cases, as it may reasonably take that time to raise the finance for the full production budget). Producers and the grantor of the option may have different views as to whether the option fees are deducted from the purchase price paid upon the exercise of the option.</entry>
</row>
<row>
<entry align="left" spanname="SPAN1"><?Pub _cellfont TypeSize="9pt"?>For the purposes of copyright law, the option agreement must grant permission to the producer to do the development work for the concept (see clauses 1, 6 and 7). This option agreement is for the development of a &ldquo;pilot&rdquo; program intended for transmission to the public (or order to assess the reaction of the television audience to the concept). Thought will need to be given to what happens to the copyright in the development materials, in the event the producer does not exercise the option, or does exercise the option, but does not then proceed to produce programming based on the concept. The grantor of the concept may assert that the copyright in the development materials should revert to the grantor in order to avoid a split in ownership between the concept and development materials (which are, for the purpose of copyright law, an &ldquo;adaptation&rdquo; of the concept). However, the producer can assert that there be some formula for payment to the producer for the cost of the development materials; producers can also assert that the state, territory and federal film and television bodies and any other financier of the development materials will expect to have a copyright interest or security interest in the development materials created by the producer, which are financed by such entities.</entry>

<entry align="left" spanname="SPAN1"><?Pub _cellfont TypeSize="9pt"?>While sections 16, 119, 196 and 239 of the Copyright Act 1968 (Cth) contemplate &ldquo;exclusive licences&rdquo; and &ldquo;assignments&rdquo; (where a person with an &ldquo;exclusive licence&rdquo; has similar causes of action to a person with an &ldquo;assignment&rdquo;), the practice in the film and television industry is to provide for the long-term grant of rights (upon the exercise of the option) as an &ldquo;assignment&rdquo; of the copyright. This practice is driven by the expectations of financiers, distributors and broadcasters (particularly international entities) who may insist that the producer holds the rights in the form of an assignment. Note that under section 213 of the Copyright Act 1968 (Cth) copyright is &ldquo;divisible&rdquo; so that owners of copyright can deal in the copyright as a property right, by retaining elements of the copyright, and by assigning or licensing to different entities different exploitation rights.</entry>

</row>
<row>
<entry align="left" spanname="SPAN1"><?Pub _cellfont TypeSize="9pt"?>The drafting of a grant of rights clause is important. The financiers, distributors and broadcasters would expect to see a grant of rights which is appropriate for all the media in which concept can be exploited.

</row>
<row>
<entry align="left" spanname="SPAN1"><?Pub _cellfont TypeSize="9pt"?>The grant of rights clause for a novel (suitable for adaptation into a film script) or original film script would be much more extensive than for concepts intended to be exploited by this &ldquo;Television program option agreement and assignment deed&rdquo;. Concepts, &ldquo;literary works&rdquo; or &ldquo;dramatic works&rdquo; have the potential to be produced in different formats (feature films, telemovies, television series and serials); and have subsequent audiovisual exploitation (so-called &ldquo;prequels&rdquo;, &ldquo;sequels&rdquo;, &ldquo;remakes&rdquo; and &ldquo;spin-offs&rdquo;); and have ancillary exploitation potential (book publishing, computer games, and merchandising based on the characters and trade marks associated with the audiovisual productions). The extent of the grant of rights needed for such audiovisual and ancillary exploitation can be seen in the investment guidelines and draft production and investment agreement (PIA) of Screen Australia (<xref

<entry align="left" spanname="SPAN1"><?Pub _cellfont TypeSize="9pt"?>Hard bargaining can be expected in relation to &ldquo;ancillary rights&rdquo; (including merchandising). The Muppets, Star Wars and The Simpsons have shown that the residual commercial value can on occasion exceed the income from the program broadcasts. If conceded (as it often is in Australia), then there must be an adequate formula for a share of the receipts, and an audit provision that will allow proper verification of the income.</entry>

</row>
<row>
<entry align="left" spanname="SPAN1"><?Pub _cellfont TypeSize="9pt"?>This precedent is a release provided by the publisher of a literary work (such as a published novel) for the benefit of the producer of an audiovisual production that is adapted from the literary work. The purpose of this precedent is to disclaim any rights to the film adaptation rights being exploited by the producer.</entry>
</row>
<row>
<entry align="left" spanname="SPAN1"><?Pub _cellfont TypeSize="9pt"?>Financiers of cinematograph films (used in the sense, as defined in the Copyright Act 1968 (Cth), of any form of moving picture) may expect to investigate the &ldquo;chain of title&rdquo; documents in order to confirm the production company controls the rights to make films adapted from the source material. Where the source material is a published book, the financier may either expect to see the book publishing agreement or expect the production company to obtain written confirmation from the book publisher in the form of a &ldquo;publisher&rsquo;s release&rdquo; (also referred to as a &ldquo;quit-claim&rdquo;). Book publishing agreements vary in their effect &mdash; the author may retain the cinematograph film adaptation rights (so can grant these rights to the production company), an alternative style of book publishing agreement is that the publisher takes all rights from the author and acts as the author&rsquo;s agent in dealing with the cinematograph film adaptation rights (so that the publisher will be a contracting party in the &ldquo;Script option and assignment agreement&rdquo;).</entry>
</row>
<row>
<entry align="left" spanname="SPAN1"><?Pub _cellfont TypeSize="9pt"?>Even where the book publishing agreement is reviewed, as part of the due diligence investigation of the film&rsquo;s &ldquo;chain of title&rdquo;, the financier may still expect to receive a publisher&rsquo;s release as the document has several purposes, first, to confirm that the publisher itself does not own or control any of the rights required by the company to produce a feature film or any other form of audiovisual work, and second to obtain the consent of the publisher for the exercise of the synopsis rights (as the publication of synopses may be within the rights which the publisher controls).</entry>

<entry align="left" spanname="SPAN1"><?Pub _cellfont TypeSize="9pt"?>Book publishers may be interested in avoiding books being released into the market by the production company (or its licensees), when they compete with the source material, which the book publisher has in the market. The book publishing agreement may give the book publisher the ability to restrict the ancillary publication of books based on the film. If so, paragraph 2 may need to be amended to clarify what forms of publication the publisher is &ldquo;releasing&rdquo; to the production company.</entry>
</row>
<row>
<entry align="left" spanname="SPAN1"><?Pub _cellfont TypeSize="9pt"?>Even where the book publishing agreement gives the publisher control over publication of all books adapted from the source material the production company may be able to negotiate with the publisher for the film-related publishing. The publisher can benefit from access to photographs and other material from the film to publish a new edition of the source material (a film &ldquo;tie-in&rdquo; edition).</entry>
</row>

</row>
<row>
<entry align="left" spanname="SPAN1"><?Pub _cellfont TypeSize="9pt"?>The level of &ldquo;in house&rdquo; expertise that the Website Operator has may impact on how the relationship with the Contractor is managed. For example, whether there is an information technology manager on staff who can take responsibility for the project management and have an ongoing role in the maintenance of the completed website. The commissioning entity could contract with a project manager to act on its behalf in supervision of the Contractor, or the appropriate managers of the commissioning entity may project manage and approve aspects of the development of the website, which falls within the expertise or responsibility of a particular manager.</entry>

<entry align="left" spanname="SPAN1"><?Pub _cellfont TypeSize="9pt"?>The level of complexity needed in a &ldquo;Website development agreement&rdquo; would be determined by the complexity, or otherwise, of the intended development of the website. The construction of a website is an exercise in project management so that the agreement is structured to achieve some control mechanisms, by the entity commissioning the website, over the development of the website. Conversely the website developer needs some certainty over changes, as particularly in a fixed price contract, these changes will impact on both the time needed to complete the development and the profitability of the &ldquo;Website development agreement&rdquo;. A simplified version of this &ldquo;Website development agreement&rdquo; could be appropriate for a low-cost website which is intended to achieve a limited function of a presence on the World Wide Web to enable the operator to provide some information and promotional material and an email communication to the operator of the website. A simplified version of this agreement may also be appropriate for a website using a website &ldquo;engine&rdquo; which has been established to be stable and having the performance requirements expected by the operator of the website.</entry>

The design of the online contracting process can result in the terms of service of the website or app being vulnerable to legal challenge. Litigation to enforce the &ldquo;Website &mdash; terms of access&rdquo; may require the website operator to establish there is an offer and acceptance and the incorporated into the contract of terms located on the website. The legal issues are an extension into the digital environment of the &ldquo;ticket cases&rdquo;, eg <emphasis
type="ital">Thornton v Shoe Lane Parking Ltd</emphasis> [1971] 2 QB 163; [1971] 1 All ER 686; [1971] 2 WLR 585; [1971] 1 Lloyd&rsquo;s Rep 289. See <emphasis type="ital">eBay v Creative Festival</emphasis> (2006) 170 FCR 450; [2006] FCA 1768; BC200610545 which considers the incorporation of terms into online contracts.</entry>
</row>
<row>
<entry align="left" spanname="SPAN1"><?Pub _cellfont TypeSize="9pt"?>The terms of service are commonly set up for consumer acceptance as either a &ldquo;browsewrap&rdquo; or &ldquo;click-through&rdquo; agreement. A browsewrap agreement relies upon the terms of service being available for viewing, with the common practice to provide a link from a page of the website &mdash; usually from the bottom of the page. Click-through agreements provide for an &ldquo;acceptance box&rdquo; that the user must click during the process of completing a transaction or when a user is required to register to use a website. Requiring the user to affirmatively accept the terms of use, results in the terms of use of the website being less exposed to legal challenge.</entry>
</row>
<row>
<entry align="left" spanname="SPAN1"><?Pub _cellfont TypeSize="9pt"?>Where the terms of access are presented as a browsewrap, then the acceptance of the Terms of access can be argued to be the acceptance by conduct: <emphasis type="ital">Empirnall Holdings v Machon Paull Partners</emphasis

However, note that decisions of US courts involving browsewrap agreements have determined that the terms are unenforceable where the user had to scroll to the bottom of the page and click a link to find the terms of service. In re Zappos.com Inc, Customer Data Security Breach Litigation, 893 F.Supp.2d 1058 (D. Nev. 2012), resulted in the US Federal District Court determining that a user of a website &ldquo;cannot assent to terms of which it has no knowledge or constructive notice, and a highly inconspicuous hyperlink buried among a sea of links does not provide such notice. Because the Plaintiffs did not assent to the terms, no contract exists&rdquo;.</entry>

<entry align="left" spanname="SPAN1"><?Pub _cellfont TypeSize="9pt"?>Click-through agreements provide advantages over presenting the terms of access in the form of a browsewrap agreement. However, <emphasis type="ital">Toll v Alphapharm</emphasis> (2004) 219 CLR 165; 79 ALJR 129; 211 ALR 342; [2004] HCA 52 can be relied upon to argue that presenting the terms of access in the form of a browsewrap agreement can effect the incorporation of terms of contract where the link to the terms of access are readily available to be viewed by users of a website. In <emphasis
type="ital">Toll v Alphapharm</emphasis>, the High Court confirmed that a person will be bound by the provisions of a contract, whether they choose to read the provisions or not. However, there must actual or constructive assent to any contractual terms. See <emphasis
type="ital">Gonzalez v Agoda Co Pte Ltd</emphasis> [2017] NSWSC 1133; BC201706887 (28 August 2017), which applied the general rule expressed in <emphasis type="ital">Toll v Alphapharm</emphasis> at [185], such that, having provided a digital signature, the plaintiff was bound by the terms, and any failure to read and comprehend the terms was immaterial.</entry>

<entry align="left" spanname="SPAN1"><?Pub _cellfont TypeSize="9pt"?>In <emphasis type="ital">Gonzales v Agoda</emphasis> at [120]&ndash;[126] the court, while not determining the issue, considered that, prima facie, an exclusive jurisdiction clause was incorporated into the terms of contract by reference and by signature (as understood by section 9(1) Electronic Transactions Act 2000 (NSW)), as the result of clicking on a button marked &ldquo;Book Now&rdquo;; the words &ldquo;I agree with the booking conditions and general terms by booking this room &mldr;&rdquo; appeared above that button. The court applied the approach set out in <emphasis
type="ital">Toll v Alphapharm</emphasis> and considered that on an objective analysis the intention was to incorporate the linked terms into the contract between the parties, taking into account: the digital signature that occurred by clicking the &ldquo;Book Now&rdquo; button; the location of the linked terms (above the &ldquo;Book Now&rdquo; button); the standard nature of the terms; and their location on the website in that the term were available to be read.</entry>

<?PubTbl row rht="0.34in"?>
<entry align="left" spanname="SPAN1"><?Pub _cellfont TypeSize="9pt"?>Another feature of online contracts are provisions that reserve the ability to unilaterally change the terms of service. In Australia the primary challenge to such provisions will be through the application of the unfair contract terms regime in part 2-3 of the Australian Consumer Law (ACL). In <emphasis
type="ital">Harris v Blockbuster</emphasis> (622 F.Supp.2d 396 (2009), the Federal District Court of Texas held that the contract is illusory where the provisions can be unilaterally changed anytime to anything. However unilateral change provisions have survived challenge in the US courts where the user is provided with notice of the change and has the ability to opt-out of the change or has the ability to stop using the service.</entry>
</row>
<row>
<entry align="left" spanname="SPAN1"><?Pub _cellfont TypeSize="9pt"?>The use of unilateral amendment provisions is not necessary where the website is carrying out a transaction each time a user returns to the site &mdash; the user can be presented with the current terms when they click-through to complete the transaction. The use of unilateral amendment also creates vulnerabilities in relation to the enforcing terms of service when the website is providing ongoing services to users, although US cases establish that a carefully drafted provision can survive challenge.</entry>

In order to build community trust and confidence in a website, the practice of many website operators is to describe the types of &ldquo;cookies&rdquo; used on a website and the purpose of those &ldquo;cookies&rdquo;, despite the operation of the &ldquo;cookie&rdquo; does not result in the collection of personal information as defined in the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth).</entry>

The High Court considered that the covenant not to disclose information (which was not limited to information outside the public domain nor limited in time) was an unenforceable restraint of trade. While that case involved confidentiality of information related to a patented invention, the High Court decision nevertheless draws attention to the need to take account of circumstances in which the information (which is intended to be held in confidence) may become public knowledge without the disclosure to the public being any &ldquo;fault&rdquo; of the party giving the confidentiality undertaking. A &ldquo;blanket&rdquo; confidentiality clause runs the risk of being invalid and unenforceable under the doctrine of restraint of trade if it does not acknowledge the circumstances in which information may become &ldquo;public domain&rdquo; information.</entry>

</row>
<row>
<entry align="left" spanname="SPAN1"><?Pub _cellfont TypeSize="9pt"?>This is an agreement between an investor and a producer by which the producer develops and produces a multimedia product or service for commercialisation &mdash; including its development, production, manufacture, publication, promotion, marketing, etc. The term &ldquo;multimedia&rdquo; is used to describe a combination of production elements such as audio, video, photos or text. The use of &ldquo;multimedia&rdquo; in this agreement is intended to cover digital productions, both on-line and off-line (that are delivered on disc or some other storage medium). </entry>
</row>
<row>
<entry align="left" spanname="SPAN1"><?Pub _cellfont TypeSize="9pt"?>There are other terms used to describe productions that involve digital delivery using different communication media. The term &ldquo;transmedia&rdquo; is used to describe a style of creating a story experience that is told using multiple media platforms and formats, which interact with each other in a complex relationship and &ldquo;crossmedia&rdquo; is a term used to describe where the same story is exploited across multiple mediums such as film, video games and on-line, although the different media do not interact in presenting the same story experience. </entry>
</row>
<row>
<entry align="left" spanname="SPAN1"><?Pub _cellfont TypeSize="9pt"?>The description and specification of the project in item 1 of schedule 1should describe the nature of the project; if &ldquo;multimedia product&rdquo; is not an appropriate descriptor of the project then some other descriptor can be used.</entry>

</row>
<row>
<entry align="left" spanname="SPAN1"><?Pub _cellfont TypeSize="9pt"?>How &ldquo;investor&rdquo; is defined and used in the agreement should be reviewed in order that the use is consistent and achieves an appropriate allocation of rights and duties between investing parties. For example, it may be appropriate that one investing party is identified as managing the escrow arrangements in clause 7 for the source code and object code embodied in or relating to the multimedia product. The agreement contemplates the investor(s) appointing the following personnel to manage aspects of the dealings with the producer: The investor&rsquo;s representative (as referred to in clauses 5.5, 5.6, 8.5, 10.3 and 10.4 &mdash; the person or persons named in item 5(b) of schedule 1). Where there are more than one investor, each investor is expected to appoint a representative; and the nominated officer (as referred to in clauses 2.1, 2.2, 3.3, 5.1 &ndash; 5.3, 6.1 and 6.3 &mdash; the person named in item 5(c) of schedule 1. Where there is more than one investor, those investors are expected to appoint a project manager as the nominated officer, who will make decisions on behalf of all the investors in relation to the production of the multimedia product or service.</entry>

<entry align="left" spanname="SPAN1"><?Pub _cellfont TypeSize="9pt"?>This precedent is an agreement between a licensor and a producer for the use of particular licensed material as part of a multimedia or transmedia product. This material would be licensed to the producer for a specified purpose on the understanding that the multimedia or transmedia product developed by the producer would then be commercialised in agreed formats.</entry>
</row>
<row>
<entry align="left" spanname="SPAN1"><?Pub _cellfont TypeSize="9pt"?>The term &ldquo;multimedia&rdquo; is used to describe a combination of production elements such as audio, video, photos or text. There are other terms used to describe productions that involve digital delivery using different communication media. The term &ldquo;transmedia&rdquo; is used to describe a style of creating a story experience that is told using multiple media platforms and formats, which interact with each other in a complex relationship and &ldquo;crossmedia&rdquo; is a term used to describe where the same story is exploited across multiple mediums such as film, video games and on-line, although the different media do not interact in presenting the same story experience. The description of the purpose and the agreed formats in items 2 and 3 of schedule 1 should describe the nature of the project, if &ldquo;multimedia product&rdquo; is not an appropriate descriptor of the project then some other descriptor can be used.</entry>

<entry align="left" spanname="SPAN1"><?Pub _cellfont TypeSize="9pt"?>This precedent is an agreement by which the producer obtains an option to require the execution in its favour of a deed of assignment (eg precedent &ldquo;Deed of assignment&rdquo;) or licence agreement (eg precedent &ldquo;Licence agreement&rdquo;). The optioning of copyright material is often done in circumstances in which producer of a technology or entertainment product needs to secure financing before they are in a position to pay the rights fees under the &ldquo;Deed of assignment&rdquo;. Obtaining the option secures the rights for a period of time with the producer able to exercise the option by paying the rights fees due on the exercise of the option. If the producer is unable to exercise the option, then the option will lapse.</entry>

<row>
<entry align="left" spanname="SPAN1"><?Pub _cellfont TypeSize="9pt"?>This precedent is an agreement between the assignor and the producer (the &ldquo;assignee&rdquo;) for the assignment of intellectual property rights to the producer.</entry>
</row>
<row>
<entry align="left" spanname="SPAN1"><?Pub _cellfont TypeSize="9pt"?>The material that is the subject of this agreement is defined in schedule 1 of this agreement. Each party provides warranties to the other party that it has the authority to enter and to perform its obligations under this agreement and that it has the ability to perform its obligations. There are a number of warranties specific to the assignor, where they warrant to the producer that they have the right to grant the rights that are the subject of this agreement, that the grant of these rights will not infringe the rights of any other person, and that the information they have provided to the producer is true and not misleading. Otherwise, this agreement provides for the terms one would expect in a deed of assignment for any other product or service.</entry>

Note that moral rights, as an author in respect of a work and as a performer in respect of a performance, are not transmissible by assignment (sections 195AN(3), 195ANB(3). However, authors and performers may consent to any act or omission that may otherwise be an infringement of moral rights (sections 195AW, 195AWA,195AXJ). In contrast, copyright is a property right and is transmissible by assignment (section 196) as are registered trade marks, service marks, designs and patents under their respective statutes.</entry>
</row>
<row>
<entry align="left" spanname="SPAN1"><?Pub _cellfont TypeSize="9pt"?>The definition of confidential information in this deed is focused on the trade secrets, know how etc that may be the subject of the assignment. This definition should be compared to that which appears in the precedent&ldquo;Option deed&rdquo;, which focuses on a range of information related to the option transaction that the contracting parties may wish to keep secret. Clause 5(a) addresses the information that the assignor may retain (because of the nature of the information) regardless ifthe assignment includes the equitable interests in the confidential information. For the basis of protection of confidential information under the law of equity rather than as a proprietary right, see <emphasis
type="ital">Moorgate Tobacco Co Ltd v Phillip Morris Ltd</emphasis> (1984) 156 CLR 414; 56 ALR 193; 3 IPR 545; BC8400490; <emphasis type="ital">Julie Breen v Cholmondeley W Williams</emphasis> (1996) 186 CLR 71; 43 ALD 481; 138 ALR 259; BC9604086. Clauses 5(b) and 5(c) provide for the assignor&rsquo;s ongoing obligation of confidence in relation to any assigned confidential information (as defined in clause 1) or in relation to other technical or business information disclosed by the producer to the assignor.</entry>
</row>
<row>
<entry align="left" spanname="SPAN1"><?Pub _cellfont TypeSize="9pt"?>When trade secrets, know how etc are not the subject of the assignment, then it may be appropriate to use the definition of confidential information that appears in the precedent &ldquo;Option deed&rdquo;, and also use what appears as clause 10 of the precedent &ldquo;Option deed&rdquo; instead of clause 5 as used in this precedent.</entry>

<entry align="left" spanname="SPAN1"><?Pub _cellfont TypeSize="9pt"?>The drafting of this confidentiality agreement takes account of decision in <emphasis type="ital">Maggbury Pty Ltd v Hafele Australia Pty Ltd</emphasis> (2001) 210 CLR 181; 185 ALR 152; [2001] HCA 70; BC200107781. The High Court considered that the covenant not to disclose information (which was not limited to information outside the &ldquo;public domain&rdquo; nor limited in time) was an unenforceable restraint of trade. While that case involved confidentiality of information related to a patented invention, the High Court decision nevertheless draws attention to the need to take account of circumstances in which the information (which is intended to be held in confidence) may become public knowledge without the disclosure to the public being any &ldquo;fault&rdquo; of the party giving the confidentiality undertaking. A &ldquo;blanket&rdquo; confidentiality clause runs the risk of being invalid and unenforceable under the doctrine of restraint of trade if it does not acknowledge the circumstances in which information may become &ldquo;public domain&rdquo; information.</entry>

<entry align="left" spanname="SPAN1"><?Pub _cellfont TypeSize="9pt"?>The drafting of this confidentiality agreement takes account of decision in <emphasis type="ital">Maggbury Pty Ltd v Hafele Australia Pty Ltd</emphasis> (2001) 210 CLR 181; 185 ALR 152; [2001] HCA 70; BC200107781. The High Court considered that the covenant not to disclose information (which was not limited to information outside the &ldquo;public domain&rdquo; nor limited in time) was an unenforceable restraint of trade. While that case involved confidentiality of information related to a patented invention, the High Court decision nevertheless draws attention to the need to take account of circumstances in which the information (which is intended to be held in confidence) may become public knowledge without the disclosure to the public being any &ldquo;fault&rdquo; of the party giving the confidentiality undertaking. A &ldquo;blanket&rdquo; confidentiality clause runs the risk of being invalid and unenforceable under the doctrine of restraint of trade if it does not acknowledge the circumstances in which information may become &ldquo;public domain&rdquo; information.</entry>

<entry align="left" spanname="SPAN1"><?Pub _cellfont TypeSize="9pt"?>This precedent is an agreement between a producer and a publisher/distributor for the publication and marketing of multimedia products that have been developed or are planned to be developed by the producer. An affiliate label agreement is intended for the distribution of a multimedia product in disc format, in contrast, precedent &ldquo;Distribution agreement &mdash; online and electronic formats&rdquo; is an on-line distribution agreement for online and electronic formats.</entry>
</row>
<row>
<entry align="left" spanname="SPAN1"><?Pub _cellfont TypeSize="9pt"?>An affiliate label agreement is intended for the distribution of a multimedia product in disc format. The agreement operates with the producer replicating and packaging the multimedia product under the producer&rsquo;s own trade marks and brands. The manufacture of the discs would be contracted using the &ldquo;Replication agreement&rdquo;. The producer delivers the packaged multimedia product to the affiliate label publisher, which acts as the distributor using the sales personnel and distribution channels that the affiliate label publisher has established.</entry>
</row>
<row>
<entry align="left" spanname="SPAN1"><?Pub _cellfont TypeSize="9pt"?>It is possible that the distribution rights held by the affiliate label publisher is limited to specific markets or disc formats. There can be differing levels of assistance that the producer is expected to provide to the affiliate label publisher. For example, an affiliate label publisher may expect the producer to pay for advertising for the multimedia product or advance funds for marketing expenses or those costs can be recouped by the affiliate label publisher from gross revenue. The producer and the &ldquo;affiliate label&rdquo; will agreed as to the responsibilities as to marketing, inventory management and customer service each will provide. As the commitments of the producer under the affiliate deal agreement are greater than the commitments under a distribution agreement, the producer would expect to achieve better financial terms under the affiliate deal agreement as compared to the distribution agreement.</entry>

There are other terms used to describe productions that involve digital delivery using different communication media. The term &ldquo;transmedia&rdquo; is used to describe a style of creating a story experience that is told using multiple media platforms and formats, which interact with each other in a complex relationship and &ldquo;crossmedia&rdquo; is a term used to describe where the same story is exploited across multiple mediums such as film, video games and on-line, although the different media do not interact in presenting the same story experience. The description and specification of the project in item 1 of schedule 1 should describe the nature of the project, if &ldquo;multimedia product&rdquo; is not an appropriate descriptor of the project then some other descriptor can be used.</entry>
