<intro.note>
<title>Introductory note</title>
<p><ptext>This agreement is used where there is a sale and purchase of hardware equipment.</ptext></p>
<p><ptext>It is increasingly common for these types of agreements to be in a standard format, issued by the supplier, with a consequent restriction on the ability of the customer to engage in realistic negotiations (albeit with a risk that the supplier might in some circumstances contravene the unfair contract provisions of the Australian Consumer Law if the terms are unduly one-sided).</ptext></p>

<title>Customer’s bargaining power</title>
<p><ptext>Nevertheless, there will be situations in which a customer has sufficient bargaining power to negotiate the terms and ensure that the agreement is at least even-handed. </ptext></p>
<p><ptext>Where a customer has the ability to negotiate, the clauses most likely to be the subject of discussion between the parties will involve the extent of the customer's responsibility 
to prepare the site, milestone dates for delivery and (if relevant) installation, the nature of any acceptance testing to be carried out on the equipment prior to final payment, the extent of supplier warranties and the extent to which the supplier seeks to exclude or cap its liability.</ptext></p>
